# DayTrack
Generic daily logging mobile app

The purpose of this app is to keep track of whether you've done something, or how many times you've done something, on a given day.
It is a Xamarin.Forms project, currently only targetting Android (but I'm not opposed to adding support for other platforms in the future).

This project is a work in progress. For work items, please see the Azure DevOps page [here](https://dev.azure.com/collenirwin/DayTrack).
